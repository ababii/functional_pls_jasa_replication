## Overview
This file describes variables in the corn.csv and soybeans.csv datasets used for the empirical analysis in 
"Functional Partial Least-Squares: Adaptive Estimation and Inference".

## Data Sources: the original study of Schlenker & Roberts (PNAS, 2009) compiled a dataset from publicly available sources:
- Weather Data: PRISM Climate Group (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model)
- Yield Data: USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
- Sample Period: 1950-2020
- Unit of Analysis: county-year observations
