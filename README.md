JASA Reproducibility Materials
================

This repository contains the necessary codes to reproduce the results in the paper "Functional Partial Least-Squares: Adaptive Estimation and Inference" by Andrii Babii, Marine Carrasco, and Idriss Tsafack. The repository consists of the following three Jupyter notebooks:
1. data_cleaning.ipynb: Python code used to prepare the data. The data can be downloaded from https://www.wolfram-schlenker.info/replicationFiles/SchlenkerRoberts2009.zip. We also provide two clean CSV files in a zip folder.
2. empirical_application.ipynb: Python code used to produce empirical results using the data generated by data_cleaning.ipynb.ipynb
3. simulations.ipynb: Julia code used to produce Monte Carlo simulations
